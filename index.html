                                    I was personally invited to attend the first ever annual Hack The Planet,
                                    organized by Major League Hacking, the leaders of the Hackathon
                                    scene. This was due to my outstanding performance and attendance during the 2014-2015
                                    hackathon season, as that was the season where I really started to shine,
                                    placing in the top ten at MHacks IV, winning best mobile at HackCWRU, and many more.

                                    Hackathon, during Spring of 2016. We made two projects, all under the
                                    umbrella of Memory Technology. We created a way for you to not forget things
                                    at home with the use of bluetooth beacons and a mobile app, and also a watch
                                    that would help alzheimer's patients keep their mind trained and their
                                    caretaker informed of their behaviors and their brain activity.

                                    After creating a shooting gallery game at Hack Illinois 2014, I was asked
                                    by the leaders of Hacksu to give a presentation to the group, which
                                    is Kent State's computer science and hacker group on campus. I was
                                    more than happy to accept and present this awesome new technology
                                    to everyone else so that they can start having fun with it too
                                    and make awesome games and apps like me. I showed them a demo of my
                                    shooting gallery game, in which your hand gestures allow you to aim
                                    and shoot and reload your weapon. It's very cool.

                                    My project for the Hackathon held at Case Western Reserve University
                                    was a mobile app that I developed along side with designer Matt
                                    Allen and programmer Nic Linscott called Oh (on the android app store), that allows you to import
                                    your favorite contacts and with a swipe left or right, you would sent them
                                    one of two direct text messages: 'Here', or 'On My Way', which was
                                    done to minimize texting while driving, which is when you would
                                    have to send either of those texts most of the time. We won the
                                    Best Mobile App award and I recieved a Nexus 7 tablet!

                                        I got into competitive fighting games and started a local fighting game club at
                                        Kent State University called Kent Fighting Game Community during Spring of 2019. The intent was to foster
                                        a community of like-minded people who are interested in playing fighting games
                                        competitively and casually, and make everyone feel welcome and comfortable
                                        no matter their background. We thankfully succeeded and continued to host events
                                        and tournaments since then, and have fostered some of the best players in the region
                                        in multiple fighting games, like Dragon Ball FighterZ, Guilty Gear Strive, and Tekken 7,
                                        amongst many more. We hope to continue supporting the local scene and bring these
                                        events to many more people in the future!

                                        I started playing guitar during August of 2009, and since then
                                        I have been in multiple bands, performed countless times as
                                        a lead guitarist in bands in addition to playing solo shows
                                        with me improvising over my own created backing tracks
                                        and covering songs I like. I love performing and playing
                                        music and somehow I want to incorporate it into what I
                                        do for a living. Or at least keep on playing as long as I can.

                            I was a part of the Advanced Telerobotics Lab team for World Robot Summit for the 2018 and 2021 competitions. This is 
                            the lab where I work for my PhD with Dr. Jong-Hoon Kim. My role was the Virtual Reality telepresence between the operator
                            and the remote robot(s), building an interface to allow for immersive dynamic control. The goal is to allow the operator
                            the freedom to do what they need to during the mission, while making sure they are getting the appropriate amount of information
                            in a timely fashion from the robot and other operators. Here you can see some demonstrations and the roles performed by my colleagues 
                            as well.

                            This short documentary was done by the talented Zaria Johnson as a project for her studies. She was able to masterfully highlight
                            the beginnings of the Kent Fighting Game community through various clips and interviews that were very well edited together. The 
                            Kent Fighting Game community was a club that I founded with others at KSU in Spring of 2019, along with my co-president Lonché Thrash, who 
                            was instrumental in the success of the organization as well. We started Kent FGC as a way to bring people together to play fighting games 
                            in an environment that allowed both competitive and casual players to thrive and be comfortable amongst their peers. We wanted to foster a 
                            community that helped each other grow and always stood for what was best for our fellow players.

                                During the third year of my undergraduate studies,
                                I took an Intro to Video Game Programming class that focused on
                                Microsoft XNA and Unity3D. The final project was a Unity3D project,
                                and due to some creative differences with my group, I ended up having
                                to do a whole project alone in a week to get this in on time, and
                                I couldn't have been more proud of what I have accomplished for that short
                                amount of time and for this being my first ever game. It has two stages, a topdown/
                                first person shooter level and a 2-d side-scroller level. The game features
                                AI that patrol and attack you when you're close, pickups that let you upgrade your
                                weapon, health pickups, checkpoints, music, particle effects, and much more. Check out

                                During BitCamp 2015, Matthew Allen and I really wanted to
                                make something in the Unreal Engine, as we wanted to grow
                                our portfolio of games made using it as well as our skills
                                using the actual engine. So, we decided to have fun with it
                                and make a Star Wars VR Pod Racing game. We even streamed our development
                                live on twitch.tv and ended up on a VR news website with an article written
                                about our little game, which made us feel awesome! I programmed the game using
                                Unreal Engine's visual scripting tool called blueprints, as it allowed for us
                                to be able to prototype the game quicker and iterate faster for the short
                                amount of time we had during the hackathon. We had a lot of fun making it,
                                and we had features that included laps, best lap time, best total time,
                                checkpoints, speed boosts, and hover mechanics. Check out the video, I hope you
                                like it, and may the Force be with you!

                                MHacks IV was a big hackathon for me. This was the first time
                                that I used the Oculus Rift, and I actually met the CEO of Oculus
                                at that hackathon. It was during the rise of popularity for the oculus,
                                during the time of the DK2. The Oculus still was not that popular with
                                the hackathon scene but it was starting to grow so we decided to hop on early
                                and see what it's all about. It was amazing, and I loved developing with the oculus
                                rift. I created the game using Unity3D and the game put you in the shoes of a DJ
                                at a busy club featuring smoke machines, strobe lights, balls that shoot fire
                                particles when you look at it, a minigame where you do certain gestures using the
                                leap motion to get a score, and of course, the DJ part, which at this point
                                was a button that altered the music and made it seem like you were
                                a DJ applying effects to music. It was completely virtual as the use of the Leap
                                motion controller meant you used your actual hands and saw them in the game,
                                making it more immersive.

                                This is a different kind of game. It's more of a "simulator". It was
                                made with Unity3D, and the idea was to give women a model to look at
                                and see how the clothes would look on them. For the purpose of the demo,
                                we used a bodyscan of our team mate who was the person who came up
                                with the idea, and we used models made of clothes that she designed fitted
                                onto the model when the buttons are pressed. It's pretty simple, but the purpose
                                was to have a proof of concept demo to present.

                                This was the first game that I made using the Leap Motion
                                controller. This was the first time I delved into the realm of
                                virtual reality. Using hand gestures as input instead of a controller
                                or a keyboard and mouse is the coolest thing I've experienced in a while
                                and only because it actually worked really well. The leap motion
                                uses IR sensors that accurately capture each finger individually and each
                                hand seperately and each gesture you do is easily recognized and turned into
                                code using their brilliant API. So using this cool tech, I decided to make a
                                fun western style shooter game with classic moving targets. Check out the video!

                                annual Hack the Planet, Matt Allen and I decided to make a Virtual

                                is a sport that barely has any games on the market, and we could start
                                something fresh. We used the Unreal Engine and made a game where you are a
                                surfer on a surf board in the water going in the direction you look and
                                collecting things out in the ocean that increase your score. It's a fun and
                                immersive experience due to the brilliant buoyancy effect of the water and the
                                amazing visuals and lighting effects of the Unreal Engine. Unfortunately I do not
                                have a video of it, but here is a photo with a nice scene from the game!
